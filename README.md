# Immune System Fighting Simulator

Immune System Fighting Simulator is a game developed by VJZ Corporation that realistically simulates the inner workings of a human body. It uses proper scientific research and data to induce an authentic experience for players. An immersive game that you can't put down, Immune System Fighting Simulator will make learning biology fun and exhilarating. Players can choose to be a pathogen or immune system cell:

- *Lymphocyte*: small immune system cells that can easily fit through cracks and can shoot out antibody bullets (gamepass).
- *Phagocyte*: giant immune system cells that can stomp out any foreign particle in its way (can kill multiple at once).
- *Bacteria*: a pathogen whose goal is to infiltrate the body and eat nutrients to clone itself (the clones follow you).
- *Virus*: similar to bacteria, they also need to consume nutrients to replicate; however, they are not intelligent enough to follow the player.

The Immune System and Pathogen teams go head-to-head to see who can conquer the body. Will the immune system be able to defend its home?
