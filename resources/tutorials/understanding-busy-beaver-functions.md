# Understanding Busy Beaver Functions

## Introduction to Turing Machines

The Turing Machine, a concept first introduced by Alan Turing, is a abstract machine that can compute any computation that can be computed. 
From adding simple numbers to artifical intelligence, the Turing Machine can do it. 

The Turing Machine works on an infinite tape of 0s. The Turing Machine may rewrite these 0s into 1s and 0s. In some versions of the Turing Machine, the machine may write more complex information, but in this case, just zero and one.
The Turing Machine has some number of states. For each state, the TM reads the current number it is on. Depending on what it sees, it writes either 0 or 1, goes left or right, then goes into a different state.
