# Understanding the Cardinality of Infinite Sets (Basic Introduction)

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

---

The idea of infinity has been around for quite some time and has consistently proved to be helpful in mathematics. Mathematical fields of interest like calculus, geometry, and so on all have infinity related in some capacity. In the early 20th century, mathematicians tried to formalize many hypotheses, theories, and ideas. Infinity was no exception.

## Set Theory

The most widely accepted axiom of infinity is denoted as the following:

$$
\exists \textbf{I} (\emptyset \in \textbf{I} \land \forall x \in \textbf{I} ((x \cup \{ x \}) \in \textbf{I}),
$$

which essentially defines an infinite set of natural numbers.
