# Additional Resources
This webpage is our favorite, as we think it is the most important. While our website was designed for you to explore VJZ Corporation and join our community, we also want to give you the best content we can create. This page will contain guides, articles, videos, lessons, tutorials, and much more, all curated and produced by our diligent team. We think paywalls do more harm than good for all parties involved, so we made all our resources forever free of charge.
