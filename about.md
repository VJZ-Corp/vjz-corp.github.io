# Our History
A few key turning points in VJZ Corporation's history define who we are today and our goals for the future. Starting from the beginning, the concept of VJZ did not exist before 2016, and the original intent of VJZ Corporation was certainly not related to digital computing:

- **June 21, 2016** - Although our current YouTube channel was created on March 12, 2016, it was officially branded as "VJZGamingHD" on this date.

Once our channel was rebranded, we started to move towards producing educational content in the fields of mathematics. While we occasionally had gaming videos and other content, this marked the beginning of what VJZ Corporation embodies today.

- **July 31, 2019** - We released our first video on Roblox scripting. This marks our channel's first time actively teaching computing and programming topics.

After releasing a few more tutorials regarding programming and scripting with Roblox, we saw that our audience engaged with these types of videos more often. Furthermore, from our viewers liking the video to starting discussions in the comments, we knew that the community needed quick and easy-to-follow computing tutorials. This was a significant turning point for VJZ Corporation as it marked the beginning of our initiative to revolutionize digital computing. 

- **January 6, 2020** - The Github organization VJZ Corporation was created, establishing our presence within the computing community.
- **January 7, 2020** - Having major success catering to the Roblox developer community, our Roblox group was established on this date.

To celebrate the turn of the new decade, we decided to launch our Roblox group and Github organization a week into 2020. Initially, membership was low, but 2 months after the group was created, interest in VJZ Corporation in the Roblox community started to increase, as the COVID-19 pandemic caused many to stay home.

- **April 15, 2020** - Work on Immune System Fighting Simulator officially began.

We realized that, with an influx of new players on Roblox and events relating to the pandemic, we could create a fun game about how the immune system works in hopes of helping the predominantly young players of Roblox to be interested and not irrationally scared of the pandemic.

- **August 16, 2020** - Immune System Fighting Simulator was officially released to the public.

Following the release, our group membership skyrocketed. Many players had a newfound interest after playing our game, which we were delighted to hear. As time progressed, we continued to maintain our Roblox community. Still, we wanted to cater to developers who also needed our support.

- **February 7, 2021** - Toolboxal was officially released as an open-source project on Github.

We have adapted the open-source model in many of our projects throughout these years. As a result, we can enable full transparency in our code and allow the community to input and help us develop our tools, such as Toolboxal. This way, we can work together to help each other, thus continuously improving everybody's lives through digital technology.

Our YouTube channel single-handedly brought VJZ Corporation to where it is today. Without it, we would have never realized the need for us to contribute to computing, resulting in a completely different focus. While our earlier videos were focused on gaming, the videos we upload now deliver the most direct, up-to-date computing technology content we can produce.
