# Our History
There are a few key turning points in VJZ Corporation's history that define who we are today and our goals for the future. The concept of VJZ did not exist before 2016 and the original intent of VJZ Corporation was certainly not related to digital computing:

- **June 21, 2016** - Although our current YouTube channel was created on March 12, 2016, it was officially branded as "VJZGamingHD" on this date. However, the content that we regularly pushed out was soon going to change...

Once our channel was rebranded, we started to move towards producing educational content in the fields of mathematics. While we occasionally had gaming videos and other content, this marked the beginning of what VJZ Corporation embodies today.

- **July 31, 2019** - We released our first video on Roblox scripting. This marks the first time we actively taught computing and programming topics on our channel.

After releasing a few more tutorials in regards to programming and scripting with Roblox, we saw that our audience engaged with these types of videos more often. From our viewers liking the video to starting discussions in the comments, we knew that the community is in need of quick and easy to follow computing tutorials. This was a major turning point for VJZ Corporation as it marked the beginning of our initative to revolutionize digital computing. 

- **January 6, 2020** - The Github organization VJZ Corporation was created, establishing our presence within the computing community.
- **January 7, 2020** - Having major success catering to the Roblox developer community, our Roblox group was established on this date.

To celebrate the turn of the new decade, we decided to launch our Roblox group and Github organization a week into 2020. Initially, membership was low, but 2 months after the group was created, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many to stay at home and interest in VJZ Corporation in the Roblox community was increasing.

- **April 15, 2020** - Work on Immune System Fighting Simulator officialy began.

We realized that, with an influx of new players on Roblox combined with events relating to the pandemic, we could create a fun game about how the immune system works in hopes of helping the predominantly young players of Roblox to be interested and not irrationally scared of the pandemic.

- **August 16, 2020** - Immune System Fighting Simulator was officially released to the public.

Following the release, our group membership skyrocketed. Many players had a newfound interest after playing our game, which we were delighted to hear. As time progressed, we continued to maintain our Roblox community, but we also wanted to cater to developers, who may spend precious time on tasks that were not readily available to them.

- **February 7, 2021** - Toolboxal was officialy released as an open-source project on Github.

Throughout these years, we have adapted the open-source model in many of our projects. Not only can we enable full transparency in our code, but we can also allow the community to input and help us develop our tools, such as Toolboxal. This way, we can work together to help each other, thus continuously improving each other's lives through digital technology.
